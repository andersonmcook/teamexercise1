				<p class="profile-text">Hey guys.  This some info about me.  I'm the guy in the pic.  I can assure you that it's very serious and I mean it a lot.  I make music and loud, obnoxious noises.  I run a cassette label called <a href="http://www.tapesofaneongod.com">Tapes of a Neon God</a> in my spare time and I'm sure that spare time is now over.  You can find me on social media if you look hard enough, but they're not tied to me name as they are for making jokes.</p>

			<p class="profile-text">My husband and I are new to Nashville and we are enjoying all it has to offer.  We live in East Nashville and we often find ourselves walking to the <a class="profile-link" href="http://www.nashvillelifestyles.com/entertainment/a-day-in-five-points">Five Points</a> area to enjoy food and beverages.  Heading from our home in the other direction we are able to experience <a class="profile-link" href="http://www.nashville.gov/Parks-and-Recreation/Nature-Centers-and-Natural-Areas/Shelby-Bottoms-Nature-Center/Shelby-Bottoms-Park.aspx">Shelby Bottoms Nature Park</a> to enjoy the great outdoors and have some fun playing with our sheltie, Louie.  We really love living in this part of Nashville.  We are able to walk or ride bike downtown and we are taking advantage of all the fun activites that go on there.</p>
